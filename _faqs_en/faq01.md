question: What is Hack your City?
---

Hack your City is a project that was developed and conducted in 2015 in the course of the science year “city of the future” in four German cities (Berlin, Dortmund, Karlsruhe, Dresden). This year the project will start again.<br>

Hack your City wants to enable people to solve problems in their city. One of the main focuses of the project is citizen science – where citizens and local research institutions collaborate on scientific questions. The project will kick off with a two-day hackathon where the participants can create prototypes. Afterwards we will form working groups that will further develop the prototypes. Hack your City is a project by Science in Dialogue in cooperation with Siemens, the city of Cologne and the TH Cologne.<br>
