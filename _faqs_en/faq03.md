question: What is a hackathon and what is the schedule?
---

The origin of the word hacking lies in the work of hobby inventors who sound out the barriers of the possible and develop new creative solutions. Hacking is the joy of experimenting with a special twist for creativity and authenticity. The result is a hack.

At a hackathon different “hackers”, that is coders, designers, researchers and citizens come together. Everyone who is willing to find creative solutions to challenges is invited to join us. The challenges will be defined and solved by the participants. The aim of the projects is to create social benefits.

Organizational Matters and Schedule<br>
The hackathon will start on Saturday with a short introduction and lightning talks. Afterwards there will be a pitching session where the participants can present their ideas and form teams. The rest of the day the participants will work on their projects. On Sunday afternoon the results of the weekend’s work will be presented. Food, drinks and WiFi will be provided.

Is there any thematic focus for the pitch?<br>
Your pitch should reflect the topic of the event. We expect designers, coders, scientists, city planners and other participants who are interested in the cities and their challenges. So there will be an expert for every question.<br>

What should I bring?<br>
Think about all the materials and devices that could be useful or inspirational. Of course you should bring your laptop and any other stuff that is useful for your work. If you need special materials or equipment just send an e-mail to Yannick (<a href="mailto:Yannick.haan@w-i-d.de">Yannick.haan@w-i-d.de</a>), perhaps we can source it for you.<br>

Do I have to register?<br>
As we only have limited space, a free registration is required.<br>

What if I don’t have a concrete project idea?<br>
No problem at all. A lot of people use the first few hours of a hackathon to talk to different people, to brainstorm und get new ideas. Furthermore, there are always people who are looking for help with their projects.
